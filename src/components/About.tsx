      <p className=" w-full p-0 m-0">
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading novels. It's a great way for me to
        unwind and immerse myself in different worlds and stories. I also
        explore new technologies. I believe in continuous learning and always
        strive to improve both personally and professionally.
